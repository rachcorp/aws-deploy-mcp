- **Proposed Solution**: How should it work?
- **Alternatives**: What alternatives have you considered?
- **Additional Context**: Any other relevant information

## Code Style

### JavaScript Style

- Use ES6+ features where appropriate
- Follow existing code patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions
- Keep functions small and focused

### Example

```javascript
/**
 * Deploys a project to AWS Amplify
 * @param {Object} options - Deployment options
 * @param {string} options.projectPath - Path to the project
 * @param {string} options.appName - Name for the Amplify app
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} Deployment result with URL and app ID
 */
async function deployToAmplify(options) {
  // Implementation here
}
```

### File Organization

- Keep related functionality together
- Use descriptive file names
- Add module-level comments explaining the purpose
- Export functions clearly

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- src/test/deployment.test.js

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for new functionality
- Test both success and error cases
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies (AWS, GitHub)
- Keep tests focused and independent

### Example Test

```javascript
describe('deployToAmplify', () => {
  it('should deploy a React project successfully', async () => {
    // Setup
    const mockOptions = {
      projectPath: '/path/to/react/project',
      appName: 'test-app'
    };

    // Test
    const result = await deployToAmplify(mockOptions);

    // Assert
    expect(result.url).toMatch(/https:\/\/.*\.amplifyapp\.com/);
    expect(result.appId).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

## Development Tips

### Debugging

```bash
# Enable debug logging
DEBUG=aws-deploy:* npm start

# Run with verbose logging
node bin/amplify-deploy.js start --verbose
```

### Testing with Real AWS

1. Create a dedicated AWS account for testing
2. Use environment variables for credentials
3. Clean up resources after testing
4. Never commit real credentials

### MCP Protocol Integration

- Follow MCP specifications
- Test with Cursor IDE
- Ensure tools are properly exposed
- Handle errors gracefully

## Release Process

Releases are handled by maintainers:

1. Version bump following semantic versioning
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create GitHub release
4. Publish to npm
